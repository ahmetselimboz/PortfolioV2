# PortfolioV2

My personal portfolio website project.

## About the Project

PortfolioV2 is a personal portfolio website I developed to showcase my professional work and skills. I built this project using modern web development techniques and best practices.

## Technologies

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: The core front-end technologies of the project.
- **Node.js & Express.js**: Used for server-side development.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose**: Used for database management and data modeling.
- **Passport.js**: Integrated for user authentication.
- **Docker**: Used for easy deployment and portability of the application.

## Coding Standards and Considerations

While developing the project, I paid close attention to the following writing rules and coding standards:

1. **Modularity:** I divided the code into functional units, with each module designed to have a specific responsibility.
2. **Reusability:** I wrote functions and components to be reusable and extensible.
3. **Security:** I prioritized security in authentication and data management processes. I integrated Passport.js as a secure authentication mechanism.
4. **Version Control:** I managed version control of the project using Git. I ensured code tracking with meaningful commit messages and regular branch usage.
5. **Docker Usage:** I used Docker to ensure the project runs smoothly across different environments.
